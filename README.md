# MeroStudySathy

An intelligent PDF tutor that actually helps you learn instead of just highlighting text you'll never read again.

---

## The Problem

Let's be honest: learning from PDFs sucks.

You download a 200-page technical manual, open it with good intentions, and then what? You're on your own. No roadmap, no guidance, no feedback. Just you, a wall of text, and the creeping realization that you have no idea where to start.

Traditional study methods are broken:
- **No structure** - Which chapter first? What's actually important?
- **No interaction** - Reading is passive. Your brain checks out after page 3.
- **No feedback** - Did you actually understand that? Who knows.
- **No accountability** - Easy to skim, easier to forget.

You end up highlighting random sentences, taking notes you'll never review, and pretending you learned something.

## The Solution

LearnFlow turns static PDFs into interactive learning experiences. Think of it as having a patient tutor who actually read the material and knows how to teach it.

Here's what happens:

**1. Upload your PDF**  
Drop in any document - textbook, research paper, technical manual, whatever.

**2. AI analyzes and creates a learning plan**  
The system reads through your document, identifies the key concepts, and builds a structured learning path. No more guessing what to read first.

**3. Interactive teaching sessions**  
Instead of staring at walls of text, you get clear explanations following a proven teaching structure. The system breaks down concepts, explains why they matter, shows examples, and warns you about common mistakes.

**4. Practice with real questions**  
Multiple choice, short answer, and conceptual questions generated from your material. You answer, get detailed feedback, and actually know if you understood it.

**5. Track your progress**  
See what you've mastered, what needs work, and where you're struggling. No more lying to yourself about "getting it."

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- An API key from OpenAI, Google AI, or Anthropic

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parnish007/merostudysathy.git
cd merostudysathy
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`

### First-Time Setup

**1. Configure your API**

Click the settings icon. Choose your provider, paste your API key, and specify the model:
- OpenAI: `gpt-4-turbo-preview` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- Google: `gemini-pro` or `gemini-1.5-pro`
- Anthropic: `claude-3-opus-20240229` or `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`

Your key gets encrypted and stored locally. Nobody else sees it.

**2. Upload a document**

Drag and drop a PDF or paste text directly. Wait for it to process.

**3. Generate a learning plan**

Hit "Generate Plan" and let the AI analyze your document. This takes a minute or two depending on size.

**4. Start learning**

Pick a section from the sidebar. Read the explanation. Ask questions. Move to the next section when ready.

**5. Practice**

Switch to the Practice tab. Answer questions. Get feedback. See what you actually learned.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| Database | SQLite (better-sqlite3) |
| PDF Processing | pdf-parse |
| LLM Integration | OpenAI / Gemini / Claude APIs |

| Encryption | AES-256-CBC |

---

## Privacy & Security

Everything stays on your machine:
- Documents stored in local `/data` folder
- API keys encrypted with machine-specific keys
- Vector embeddings in local SQLite database
- No external servers, no data collection, no telemetry

Delete the `/data` folder and everything's gone. Simple as that.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is in the `/docs` folder:
- [Architecture Overview](./docs/architecture.md) - System design and data flow
- [API Reference](./docs/api-reference.md) - Complete endpoint documentation
- [Development Guide](./docs/development.md) - Setup and contribution guide

---

## Development

### Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production
Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Configure your LLM provider

Go to `/settings` and set:

- provider: `openai` | `gemini` | `claude`
- model: your chat model name
- api key

The API key is encrypted before local storage.
After saving, the UI intentionally shows a masked value (for example `sk-1***9x2`) instead of the raw key.

### 4. First learning flow

1. Upload a PDF or paste text on the home page.
2. Open the document page (`/doc/[id]`).
3. Click **Generate Plan**.
4. Select a plan part and start learning in chat.
5. Use practice/evaluation to update progress.

## Scripts```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Lint
```bash
npm run lint
```

## How the Teaching Works

The system follows a 7-part teaching structure based on educational research:

1. **Definition** - What is this concept?
2. **Why It Matters** - Real-world relevance
3. **Core Theory** - How it actually works
4. **Examples** - Concrete applications
5. **Common Mistakes** - What to avoid
6. **Recap** - Quick summary
7. **Next Steps** - What's coming next

Every lesson includes citations to specific pages in your document. You can verify everything.
